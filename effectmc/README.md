This is the Stream Seck plugin for EffectMC.

Making some quick notes on how this works:

- The plugin is looking for an effects.json file in this directory to use to generate the rest of the stream deck plugin.
- Run the generate task to generate the plugin.
- Use the streamdeck CLI to build and pack the plugin.
