# EffectMC
Various effects triggered in Minecraft by devices like an Elgato Stream Deck.

## How to setup:

Download the Stream Deck plugin and Minecraft mod from the [latest release](https://github.com/MoSadie/EffectMC/releases/latest)

Install the Stream Deck plugin by running the plugin file and following the prompt.

Install the Minecraft mod using the standard method for your mod loader. (Usually involves placing the correct jar file into the mods folder)

Add buttons to your Stream Deck! (See [here](docs) for the different types of buttons and how to configure them.)

Here is a video running through the setup process: [TODO: Insert Video Here]

## How to trust a device

Run the command `/effectmctrust` in Minecraft.

Send a effect.

Trust the device when prompted in Minecraft.

## How to configure the port:

After running the mod one, there should be a `effectmc` directory either with the mod jar or in the game directory. In there will be a config file that allows you to change the port the mod listens on. Don't forget to update your keys as well!
