## In-Game Experience

Three seperate title effects are triggered in this gif to give examples of a title/subtitle combo effect, a subtitle only effect, and a title/subtitle using formatting codes.

![Gif of the player staring at the sky. Three title/subtitle pairs appear on screen. The first says "Hello" with a subtitle of "World!", the second is a subtitle that says "This is only a subtitle!", and the third is multi-colored title and subtitle saying "Colors work too! Others work as well: [giberish text]"](img/show-title-example.gif)
