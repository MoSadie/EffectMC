Various effects triggered in Minecraft by devices like an Elgato Stream Deck.


## How to setup:

Instructions on how to setup the Minecraft mod and Stream Deck plugin can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/MoSadie/EffectMC/wiki/setup-guide). The latest downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/MoSadie/EffectMC/releases/latest) or on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/effectmc/files/all).

## How to configure the port:

After running the mod one, there should be a `effectmc` directory either with the mod jar or in the game directory. In there will be a config file that allows you to change the port the mod listens on. Don't forget to update your actions as well!
